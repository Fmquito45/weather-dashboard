# weather-dashboard

## Description

I built this project to help not just travelers but others as well to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so they can plan a trip accordingly. In order to build this project I had to apply new skill sets that I've learned throughout the module. This is what motivated me in creating this application, to see it come to life and be beneficial to every user checking up on the weather forecast in nearby cities. This application is very friendly-user interactive. A user simply needs to input the city they wish to forecast the weather in and click the search button. The user will be displayed with the current forecast indicating the city name, date, weather icon resembling the temperature, wind speed and humidity percentage. As well as the following 5 days to come. In order to build this project I had to apply some new skills sets to have it fucntioning properly. I had to learn how to access data and be able to use it functionally by making requests with specific parameters to a URL using third-party API's. This allowed me to retrieve data from another application's API, in this case, OpenWeather; 5 day weather forecast, and use the needed data to display in the forecast. I was required to generate a ApiKey to have full access. With a fetch request function following the user input city as an end point I was able to get data for Lattitude and Longitude to use in the base URL; (https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}). This allowed me to retreive the data for dates, temperature icons, temperature, wind speeds and humidity percentage. This was a great experience applying a new skill set to create this weather dashboard application and be avaible for user to see the weather outlook in multiple cities.
